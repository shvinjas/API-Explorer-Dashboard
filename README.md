This simple web application demonstrates fetching data from an API and displaying it on a webpage. The application fetches user data from the [ReqRes API](https://reqres.in/api/users) and provides two options for interaction:

1. **Fetch data to console:** Clicking this button fetches data from the API and logs it to the browser console.

2. **Fetch and display the data:** Clicking this button fetches data from the API, processes it, and displays the user information on the webpage.
